    "Both def statements and lambda expressions in Python are used to define functions. However, there are some differences between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Def statements are used to define a named function in Python. A named function is created using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, and a set of parentheses that can contain the function parameters. A function block is indented below the definition line and contains the function code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda expressions are a way of creating anonymous functions in Python. An anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name. It is created using the `lambda` keyword, followed by the function parameters, separated by commas, and a colon. The code that should be executed when the function is called is then defined after the colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between def statements and lambda expressions is that def statements can include multiple statements and have a return statement, whereas lambda expressions can only have one expression and that expression is returned by default."

    "2. Readability: They can help make code more readable when passing small functions as arguments to other functions.\n",

Output parameters are arguments that are passed to the function by reference, and the function can set their values.
